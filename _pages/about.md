I am a Post Doctoral researcher in the [REALab](https://real.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, working with [Prof. Shuran Song](https://shurans.github.io/). Prior to joining Stanford, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon Robotics. I obtained my PhD and MS degrees from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof [Matthew T. Mason](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mason/), obtained BoE from the department of Automation at Tsinghua University. I had also spent time at Toyota Research Institute and MIT.

My career goal is to achieve human level manipulation dexterity on robots, and I have been working on bottleneck problems towards this goal. The first bottleneck I worked on was the reliable execution of contact-rich motions under real life uncertainties, for which I developed metrics and methods for robust manipulation with active compliance control schemes in my thesis work. Then I thought the bottleneck to make robots widely useful was proper engineering, so I spent three years at Amazon robotics pushing [the Stow project](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/how-amazon-robotics-researchers-are-solving-a-beautiful-problem) from a research idea to a product. Now I see the bottleneck to be the ability to scale up the aquisition of robust, general manipulation skills, where I am working on the intersection of data-driven visual motor policies and robust model-based control.
